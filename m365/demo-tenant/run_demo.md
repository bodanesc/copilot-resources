## How to run a great demo

A crucial component of demoing the value of `Copilot for Microsoft 365` is the incorporation of relevant data and information to support your narrative. For instance, public datasets or [curated collections](#assets-to-run-the-demo) of data provide a wealth of information that can be utilized to showcase the capabilities. Additionally, for those seeking specific examples in mathematics and Excel, [Statista](https://www.statista.com/) offers a diverse range of datasets that can be downloaded in XLS format, allowing for seamless integration into your demo. 

Tailoring your demo is equally essential to ensure it speaks directly to the industry and roles of your prospective clients. One example would be embedding local  laws from your country into Word files and using Copilot for M365 to query them -- to demonstrate not only the versatility of the product, but also its adaptability to local contexts. 

Customize the demo further by highlighting features that align with the specific needs of departments such as HR, marketing or legal. This level of personalization not only showcases the utility of your offering, but also underscores its relevance to the viewer’s role, making the demonstration a powerful tool for engagement and persuasion.
