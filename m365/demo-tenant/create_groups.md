## Microsoft 365 Groups and Distribution Lists

{% include note_info.html content="This chapter takes about 10 minutes to read and 10 minutes to implement" %}

Groups and distribution lists are ways to manage and communicate with multiple users in your Microsoft 365 tenant. A group is a collection of users who share a common purpose, such as a project team or a department. A distribution list is a mailing list that allows you to send email messages to multiple recipients at once.
The main difference between groups and distribution lists is that groups have more features and functionalities than distribution lists. Groups can have shared resources, such as a mailbox, a calendar, a SharePoint site, a Planner plan, a Teams channel and more. Distribution lists only have an email address and a list of members.
