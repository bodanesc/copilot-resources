## How to buy licenses for the demo environment

In order to be able to run a demo in an independent environment, you might consider buying Microsoft 365 Business Premium licenses. Microsoft 365 Business Premium is a comprehensive cloud-based solution that includes the best-in-class productivity apps of Microsoft 365, as well as advanced security and device management features. There are different ways to buy Microsoft 365 licenses, depending on your needs and preferences. In this chapter, we will guide you through the steps to acquire your licenses.  

# Advisory

The Advisory option is the simplest and most flexible way to buy Microsoft 365 licenses. You can purchase licenses directly from Microsoft. You can choose the number of licenses you need, pay with a credit card or invoice, and manage your subscription online. You can also make changes or cancel your subscription at any time, in the terms that you have previously agreed to. The advisory option is ideal for small businesses that want to have full and direct control over their licensing and billing.

# CSP Tier 1

The CSP (Cloud Solution Provider) Tier 1 option allows you to buy Microsoft 365 licenses from a certified Microsoft Partner who is transacting directly with Microsoft and who acts as your primary point of contact for all your cloud needs. The Partner can offer you customized solutions, value-added services and technical support. You can also benefit from potential lower prices, more flexible payment terms and monthly billing. 

The CSP Tier 1 option is suitable for businesses that want to have a close relationship with a trusted partner who can help them optimize their cloud journey. It is also constructed for medium and large sized customers. Terms and conditions are to be discussed directly with a CSP Tier 1 Partner.

# CSP Tier 2

The CSP Tier 2 option is similar to the CSP Tier 1 option, except that you buy Microsoft 365 licenses from a Partner (CSP Tier 2 Reseller) who works with another Partner (CSP Tier 2 Provider) who are authorized by Microsoft. This means that you have two layers of Partners between you and Microsoft, which can add a bit of complexity and reduce some transparency. However, the CSP Tier 2 option can also offer you more choices, competition, and most of the time gives you the benefit of a local presence. 

The CSP Tier 2 option is appropriate for businesses that want to have access to a wide range of partners and solutions in their region or industry. It is also constructed for medium and smaller sized customers. Terms and conditions are to be discussed directly with a CSP Tier 2 Partner and CSP Tier 2 Provider.

# Enterprise Agreement

The Enterprise Agreement option is the most traditional and structured way to buy Microsoft 365 licenses. You sign a contract with Microsoft for a minimum of three years, during which you commit to a certain number of licenses and pay annually in advance. You can also enjoy volume discounts, price protection and software assurance benefits. 

The Enterprise Agreement option is designed for large enterprises that have more than 500 users and that want to have a long-term and stable licensing agreement with Microsoft. For this type of agreement a customer should engage with an LSP (Licensing Solutions Provider) Partner – as they are the ones authorized by Microsoft to transact this type of agreement. 

# Pricing and costs

To initiate a Copilot environment within Microsoft 365, it is essential to fulfill certain licensing requirements. Based on our previous experiences, the optimal configuration typically includes:

- [Microsoft 365 Business Premium](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/compare-all-microsoft-365-business-products)
- [Copilot for Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/copilot-for-microsoft-365#Pricing)

For an effective demonstration of the solution’s capabilities, we suggest provisioning at least three users with the following licenses:

- **3 user accounts** should be granted access to **Microsoft 365 services** through the **Business Premium plan**
- at least **1 user account** should be equipped with **Copilot for Microsoft 365**, to fully explore its features

To review the complete list of prerequisite licenses necessary for Copilot, please refer to the [**Copilot for Microsoft 365 FAQ**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/copilot-for-microsoft-365#FAQ) section.
