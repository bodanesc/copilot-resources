If you want to add a new service or more licenses to your Microsoft 365 subscription, you can do so from the admin center. In this chapter, we will show you how to buy Microsoft 365 Copilot.

1. Go to the [**Admin Center**](https://admin.microsoft.com) and sign in with your admin account.
2. On the left navigation pane, select `Billing` and then `Purchase services`.
3. On the Purchase services page, you will see a list of available services that you can buy. Scroll down until you find `Microsoft 365 Copilot for Microsoft 365` and click on `Details`.
4. On the `Microsoft 365 Copilot` page you will see the details and pricing of the service. You can choose the number of licenses you want to buy, what is the desired subscription length and the frequency at which you would like to pay. The price will adjust accordingly to the selections. 
5. Click on `Buy now` when you are ready.
6. You will be taken to the checkout page, where you can review your order and enter your payment information. Click on `Place order` when you are done.
7. You will see a confirmation page that shows your order details and you will also receive an email confirmation after the order has been made. Click on `Continue` to return to the Admin Center.
8. On the Admin Center you will see a notification that your purchase is being processed. It may take a few minutes for the service to be activated and the licenses to be assigned.

Once the service is activated, you will have the licenses Microsoft 365 Copilot in your account and they will need to be allocated to the previously created users. Please note that after adding the licenses to the users, it might take a bit to technically have the features activated for the respective users.
