# Backstory

The inception of this GitHub repository is a testament to the collaborative spirit of the technical team, comprising Partner Technology Strategists (PTSs) and Partner Solution Architects (PSAs), who are the main drivers of this initiative. Their expertise and dedication have been instrumental in creating a centralized hub for Microsoft Copilots resources. This project also benefited from the valuable insights and contributions from Partner Development Managers (PDMs), Customer Success professionals (CSs) and various other roles within the Microsoft ecosystem, ensuring a well-rounded and comprehensive repository.

This initiative was born out of the feedback we received from our partners, who expressed a need for centralized resources to streamline their interactions with Microsoft's AI tools. The repository is a response to this call, aiming to empower our partners with easy access to information and resources that will aid them in leveraging the full potential of Microsoft Copilots. It's a reflection of our commitment to listening to our partners and continuously improving our support infrastructure to meet their evolving needs.

The "About" page of this repository not only serves as a guide on how to navigate and contribute to the project, but also as a chronicle of the collective effort that brought it to fruition. It's a space where we acknowledge the diverse group of individuals who have poured their knowledge and passion into this project. From the technical teams to the partners who voiced their needs, each has played a crucial role in shaping this repository into the valuable resource it is today.

# How it works

The project operates on a robust framework that utilizes **GitHub**, **GitHub Actions** and **Jekyll** to automate and streamline the deployment process. GitHub Actions are set up to trigger workflows for various operations such as building, testing, and deploying the site whenever there's a push or pull request made to the repository. Jekyll, a static site generator, works in tandem with GitHub Actions to transform the plain text into static websites and blogs, simplifying the web publishing process. This combination ensures that the latest updates are always live, providing users with the most current information and resources available!

# Contribution

Contributing to the Microsoft Copilots GitHub repository is a straightforward process that allows for community collaboration and enhancement of the resources available.

To begin, navigate to the repository on GitHub and take a moment to familiarize yourself with the content and structure. When you're ready to contribute, start by **forking the repository** to your own GitHub account. This creates a personal copy that you can modify without affecting the original project.

Once you have forked the repository, you can make changes or additions to your copy. If you're adding new content or making significant revisions, it's a good practice to create a new branch for your changes. This keeps your contributions organized and makes it easier to track different updates. After making your changes, commit them with a clear and descriptive message that explains what you've done and why.

When you're satisfied with your contributions, it's time to share them with the community. Do this by submitting a **pull request** to the original repository. A pull request lets the project maintainers know that you have changes you'd like to merge into the main project. Be sure to provide a detailed description of your contributions and the value they add. The project maintainers will review your pull request and, if everything is in order, they will merge your changes into the repository, making your contributions available to all users.

# Reporting issues

Reporting issues is an integral part of maintaining the health and accuracy of the Microsoft Copilots GitHub repository. If you encounter any problems or have suggestions for improvements, you can use the Issues feature on GitHub to communicate them. Simply navigate to the 'Issues' tab in the repository, click on 'New Issue' and provide a detailed description of the issue or enhancement you're proposing. This allows the maintainers to track and address the concerns efficiently, ensuring the repository remains a reliable and up-to-date resource for all users.
