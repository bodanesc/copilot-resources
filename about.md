# Backstory

The inception of this GitHub repository is a testament to the collaborative spirit of the technical team, comprising Partner Technology Strategists (PTSs) and Partner Solution Architects (PSAs), who are the main drivers of this initiative. Their expertise and dedication have been instrumental in creating a centralized hub for Microsoft Copilots resources. This project also benefited from the valuable insights and contributions from Partner Development Managers (PDMs), Customer Success professionals (CSs) and various other roles within the Microsoft ecosystem, ensuring a well-rounded and comprehensive repository.

This initiative was born out of the feedback we received from our partners, who expressed a need for centralized resources to streamline their interactions with Microsoft's AI tools. The repository is a response to this call, aiming to empower our partners with easy access to information and resources that will aid them in leveraging the full potential of Microsoft Copilots. It's a reflection of our commitment to listening to our partners and continuously improving our support infrastructure to meet their evolving needs.

The "About" page of this repository not only serves as a guide on how to navigate and contribute to the project, but also as a chronicle of the collective effort that brought it to fruition. It's a space where we acknowledge the diverse group of individuals who have poured their knowledge and passion into this project. From the technical teams to the partners who voiced their needs, each has played a crucial role in shaping this repository into the valuable resource it is today.

# How it works

The project operates on a robust framework that utilizes **GitHub**, **GitHub Actions** and **Jekyll** to automate and streamline the deployment process. GitHub Actions are set up to trigger workflows for various operations such as building, testing, and deploying the site whenever there's a push or pull request made to the repository. Jekyll, a static site generator, works in tandem with GitHub Actions to transform the plain text into static websites and blogs, simplifying the web publishing process. This combination ensures that the latest updates are always live, providing users with the most current information and resources available!

# Contribution

To contribute to the Microsoft Copilots GitHub repository, you can directly create branches and pull requests without forking the repository. Simply navigate to the repository on GitHub and review its content and structure. When ready to contribute, create a new branch within the repository for your changes. This ensures that your contributions are organized and separated from the main codebase.

Once you've made your changes or additions in the branch, commit them with clear and descriptive messages explaining the modifications. After completing your changes, submit a pull request directly from your branch to the main repository. In the pull request description, detail your contributions and the value they bring to the project.

The project maintainers will review your pull request, and if all looks good, they'll merge your changes into the main repository. This process facilitates collaboration and allows your contributions to be integrated seamlessly into the project.

# Reporting issues

Reporting issues is an integral part of maintaining the health and accuracy of the Microsoft Copilots GitHub repository. If you encounter any problems or have suggestions for improvements, you can use the **Issues** feature on GitHub to communicate them. Simply navigate to the [**'Issues'**](https://github.com/bodanesc/copilot-resources/issues) tab in the repository, click on [**'New Issue'**](https://github.com/bodanesc/copilot-resources/issues/new) and provide a detailed description of the issue or enhancement you're proposing. This allows the maintainers to track and address the concerns efficiently, ensuring the repository remains a reliable and up-to-date resource for all users.
